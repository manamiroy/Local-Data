# Local Data Computations

This repository contains the code that verifies results in Section 3 of the paper Local data of rational elliptic curves with non-trivial torsion by Alexander Barrios and Manami Roy. The code was written by the authors as well.

This code was written in SageMath, and the repository consists of 8 files:

(1) Theorem3.2-Cases1-2-4.ipynb

(2) Theorem3.2-Case3.ipynb

(3) Theorem 3.3.ipynb

# Local-Data

This repository contains the code that verifies results in Section 2 of the paper Local data of rational elliptic curves with non-trivial torsion by Alexander Barrios and Manami Roy. The codes are written by the authors as well.

This code was written on SageMath, and the repository consists of 4 files:
